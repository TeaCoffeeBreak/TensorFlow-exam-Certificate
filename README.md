quote from above "I have recently taken the exam on my MacBook Pro 15" with i9 CPU. Having GPU would have been beneficial because it's faster but not I feel that GPU is necessary.
If the problem requires a complex model(not really that complex. About 3~5M parameters), about 10 epochs are sufficient which took about less than 10 minutes.
I think the camera is required to take a picture of you prior to the exam when you submit your identification and they request you to take a picture of you so that they can confirm it is really you."

"I forgot to mention that yes I passed. Grading took about 3 working days."

"The cert doesn't require going to a testing center - it just uses a plugin for PyCharm IDE"
